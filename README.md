## Hi, I'm Fidalgo.

[fidalgo.dev](https://fidalgo.dev/)

I'm Fidalgo, a 25 year old self-taught Javascript Developer, currently living in Leicester.

In October 2018 I decided it was time for a change, so I started to study Javascript before going into work. I quickly started to love Javascript and in January 2019 I decided to take the risk and quit my job. I then studied Javascript until July 2019, where I landed my first job at Mindera UK. I quickly improved my Javascript skills here and transitioned to a Full Stack position.

I always want to learn more and do more. I'm also a firm believer that we should never settle. I'm hard working, super curious, passionate, committed and a fast learner!
