## Hi, I'm Fidalgo.

[fidalgo.dev](https://fidalgo.dev/)

I&#39;m Fidalgo, a 26 year old self-taught Javascript Developer, living in Leicester and currently working at Prolific as a Frontend Engineer.

 In October 2018 I decided it was time for a change, so I started to
          study Javascript before going into work. I quickly started to love
          Javascript and in January 2019 I decided to take the risk and quit my
          job. I then studied Javascript until July 2019, where I landed my
          first job and moved to UK. I quickly improved my Javascript skills
          and transitioned to a Full Stack position.

Currently I'm at Prolific as a Frontend Engineer.

I always want to learn more and do more. I'm also a firm believer that we should never settle. I'm hard working, super curious, passionate, committed and a fast learner!
